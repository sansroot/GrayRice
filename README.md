---------------DON'T INSTALL THE MUTTER ROUNDED ON ANY DISTRO THAT IS NOT 22.04 BASED, thank you!-----------------
I recommend you making a TimeShift backup just for caution, specially if you're going to install the mutter-rounded!

For the installation, just run as root the scripts you want to install, you will get the same looking as mine.
The theme isn't finished yet, if you like it, please check soon for updates.
